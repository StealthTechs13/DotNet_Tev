    <p><strong>Honeywell Apps Privacy Notice</strong></p>
<p><strong>Last Updated: 07-Aug-2021</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Notice (as amended from time to time) provides an overview of the types of information about you (&ldquo;Personal Data&rdquo;) collected through the Honeywell Apps (defined below) by Honeywell International Inc., or the affiliate of Honeywell International Inc. that has entered into an agreement with the Customer (&ldquo;Honeywell&rdquo; or &ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) . By downloading and using one or more of the Honeywell Apps, you agree to the collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Data as set forth in this Privacy Notice. This Privacy Notice does not cover the use of data by Honeywell outside of the Honeywell Apps (defined below). See Honeywell&rsquo;s Privacy Statement at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.honeywell.com/en-us/privacy-statement">https://www.honeywell.com/en-us/privacy-statement</a> concerning information collected for business, career, sales and marketing purposes and Honeywell&rsquo;s public-facing websites.</p>
<p>Honeywell has developed numerous &ldquo;connected services&rdquo; software applications (&ldquo;apps&rdquo;), including, without limitation, the Honeywell Vector Occupant App, Honeywell Forge App, Honeywell Pulse&trade;, Honeywell Digital Video Manager and any other app made available by Honeywell that contains a link to this Privacy Notice.</p>
<p><strong>Information Processed on behalf of the Customer</strong></p>
<p>Honeywell has made the Honeywell Apps available to you as a service to and on behalf of the customer of Honeywell that provided you with details on how to register for an account on the Honeywell App(s) (the &ldquo;Customer&rdquo;). The Customer may be your employer and/or the owner, tenant or facility or property manager of the building(s) in which you will use the Honeywell Apps. The Honeywell Apps are made available to you by Honeywell at the direction of the Customer and in accordance with Honeywell&rsquo;s agreement with the Customer (the &ldquo;Customer Agreement&rdquo;). When you use the Honeywell Apps, Honeywell collects, on behalf and upon the instructions of the Customer, information relating to you and your use of the Honeywell Apps.</p>
<p>The Customer determines how Personal Data collected from or about you when you use the Honeywell Apps is used, disclosed and otherwise processed. Honeywell may use and otherwise process such information in accordance with the instructions and permissions set out in the Customer Agreement, including as set out in this Privacy Notice. This means that Honeywell processes your Personal Data as a &ldquo;data processor&rdquo; for and on behalf of the Customer who is the &ldquo;data controller&rdquo; of that information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accordingly, all Personal Data collected by Honeywell about you through the Honeywell Apps will be shared with the Customer. If you have any questions or concerns about how your Personal Data is processed, including the retention period and any consequences to you for not providing Personal Data, you should contact the person or entity who has contracted Honeywell to process this information (e.g. your employer). The Customer, as the data controller, may provide you with a privacy notice that addresses its processing of your Personal Data. We encourage you to review that to understand how the Customer will handle your Personal Data. In addition, we are making this Privacy Notice available to you so that you will understand how Honeywell, as a data processor, collects and processes your Personal Data for and on behalf of the Customer.</p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>The Legal Basis on which We Process your Personal Data</u></strong></p>
<p>To the extent required by applicable law, the Customer is responsible for ensuring that the processing of your Personal Data has a lawful basis. The legal basis for the processing of your personal data as described above will depend on the Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which it is collected. In general, it will be one of the following bases:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is necessary for the performance of the services the Customer provides to you;</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Your Choices about the Processing of Personal Data </u></strong></p>
<p>If you would like the Honeywell Apps to no longer collect your Personal Data, you may simply delete the Honeywell Apps. You may also contact the Customer&rsquo;s site administrator to assist with having your account and credentials deleted. In addition, if you would like the Honeywell Apps to no longer collect geo-location information from your mobile device, you can adjust the Location Services settings on your mobile device. However, if you adjust the Location Service settings, certain features of the Honeywell Apps will not function as intended.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Your Rights where Honeywell acts as Processor</u></strong></p>
<p>Where the processing of your Personal Data is subject to applicable local laws, you may have certain rights with respect to your Personal Data. Please note that these rights are not absolute and in certain cases subject to conditions as specified in applicable law:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may have the right to <strong>access, correct, update</strong> or request <strong>deletion</strong> of your Personal Data;</li>
<li>You can <strong>object</strong> to the processing of your personal information, ask us to <strong>restrict</strong> processing of your Personal Data or request <strong>portability</strong> of your Personal Data;</li>

<li>You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your Personal Data.</li>
</ul>
<p>We collect and process Personal Data about you on behalf of the Customer and you must contact the Customer (the data controller) if you have any questions or wish to exercise your rights.</p>
<p><strong><u>Security</u></strong></p>
<p>Honeywell is committed to protecting the security of your Personal Data. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.</p>
<p><strong><u>Children&rsquo;s Information</u></strong></p>
<p>The Honeywell Apps are not directed to, nor does Honeywell knowingly collect Personal Data about, children. If Honeywell is made aware that it has received Personal Data about a child, it will use reasonable efforts to remove that information from its records.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>International Transfers of Personal Data</u></strong></p>
<p>The Personal Data we collect in connection with the Honeywell Apps may be sent to, maintained and processed in the United States or any other country or region in which Honeywell International Inc. or its affiliates, subsidiaries, agents or suppliers are located. Although the laws that protect Personal Data in those countries may differ from the laws where you live, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. By using one or more of the Honeywell Apps and giving your Personal Data to us, you consent to the transfer and processing of your Personal Data outside of your country or region. We make sure that appropriate arrangements are in place with the Customer to ensure that such cross-border transfers comply with any applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p><strong><u>Changes to this Privacy Notice</u></strong></p>
<p>Honeywell may occasionally update this Privacy Notice. When we do, we will revise the "Last Updated" date at the top of the Privacy Notice. Your continued use of the Honeywell Apps will be deemed acceptance of any changes or updates.
